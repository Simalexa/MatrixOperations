Program can solve equation with matrix and vectors parameters.

Avaliable operations:
1. Addition of two matrix/two vectors/matrix and vector.
3. Multiplication of two matrix/two vectors/matrix and vector/
scalar and matrix/scalar and vector.

The equations are written in ".cfg" files with format "M.dat + v1.dat * x". 
Where x is input file. Instead of x could be written another file with constant 
matrix or vector values. 
All constant matrix and vectors are in dirrectory "/DatFiles".  
Result of the calculation is in file "output.dat".

To build the program:
1.Write the name of configuration file.
2.Write the name of file with values of aparameter X.

For example: 
Configuration file: f3.cfg 
Input file: x.dat
